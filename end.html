                    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. 
                    The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online 
                    services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.We do not specifically market to children under 13. Fair Information Practices The Fair
                    Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the 
                    development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is 
                    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take 
                    the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify the users via in site notification Within 1 business day We also agree 
                    to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights
                    against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
                    rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
                    by data processors.
